    "# Pincell Depletion\n",
    "This notebook is intended to introduce the reader to the depletion interface contained in OpenMC. It is recommended that you are moderately familiar with building models using the OpenMC Python API. The earlier examples are excellent starting points, as this notebook will not focus heavily on model building.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a real power reactor, the fuel composition is constantly changing as fission events produce energy, remove some fissile isotopes, and produce fission products. Other reactions, like $(n, \\alpha)$ and $(n, \\gamma)$ will alter the composition as well. Furthermore, some nuclides undergo spontaneous decay with widely ranging frequencies. Depletion is the process of modeling this behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will model a simple fuel pin in an infinite lattice using the Python API. We will then build and examine some of the necessary components for performing depletion analysis. Then, we will use the depletion interface in OpenMC to simulate the fuel pin producing power over several months. Lastly, we will wrap up with some helpful tips to improve the fidelity of depletion simulations."

    "## Helpful tips\n",
    "\n",
    "Depletion is a tricky task to get correct. Use too short of a time step, and you will incur a steep cost in computational time due to excessive transport simulations. Use too long of a time step, and you may miss physics happening on shorter timescales, leading to incorrect answers. Consider the xenon plot from above. Xenon-135 is a fission product with a thermal absorption cross section on the order of millions of barns, but it has a half life of ~9 hours. Taking smaller time steps at the beginning of your simulation to build up some equilibrium in your fission products is highly recommended.\n",
    "\n",
    "When possible, differentiate materials that reappear in multiple places. If we had built an entire core with the single `fuel` material, every pin would be depleted using the same averaged spectrum and reaction rates, which is incorrect. Pins experiencing different flux will deplete at different rates. The `Operator` can differentiate these materials using the `diff_burnable_mats` argument, but note that the volumes will be copied from the original material.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using higher-order integrators, like the `CECMIntegrator`, `EPCRK4Integrator` with a fourth order Runge-Kutta, or the `LEQIIntegrator`, can improve the accuracy of a simulation, or at least allow you to take longer depletion steps between transport simulations with similar accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fuel pins with integrated burnable absorbers, like gadolinia, experience strong flux gradients until the absorbers are mostly burned away. This means that the spectrum and magnitude of the flux at the edge of the fuel pin can be vastly different than that in the interior. The helper `pin` function can be used to subdivide regions into equal volume segments, as follows."

    "Alternatively, if we were provided the power density of our problem, we can provide this directly with `openmc.deplete.PredictorIntegrator(operator, time_steps, power_density=pdens)`. The values of `power` and `power_density` do not have to be scalars. For problems with variable power, we can provide an iterable with the same number of elements as `time_steps`."
