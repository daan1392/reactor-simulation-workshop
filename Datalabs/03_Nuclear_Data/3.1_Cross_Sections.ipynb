    "# Part 1 - Plotting isotope cross sections\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing the interaction probabilities of isotopes and materials in your model can help you understand simulation results. There are several online tools for plotting nuclear cross sections such as [www.janis.com](https://www.oecd-nea.org/jcms/pl_39910/janis), however, OpenMC can also plot cross sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "This python notebook allows users to plot neutron interaction cross sections for specific isotopes using OpenMC.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this first part of the task we are plotting the <b>microscopic</b> cross-section \"<b>œÉ</b>\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Microscopic cross section is the effective target area in $\\mathrm{m}^2$ presented by a single nucleus to an incident neutron beam.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is used to characterize the probability of reaction between a neutron and an individual nucleus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Microscopic is often stated in units of barns where 1 barn is equal to $10^{‚àí28}$ $\\mathrm{m}^2$ "

    "# Neutron Reactions in Fission Systems  \n",
    "\n",
    "In a nuclear reactor, neutron interactions with fuel isotopes determine the overall reactor behavior. Two key reactions are:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fission**: A neutron induces the splitting of a heavy nucleus, releasing energy and more neutrons. This is crucial for sustaining a chain reaction.  \n",
    "- **Radiative Capture** (\\(n, \\gamma\\)): A neutron is absorbed without causing fission, leading to isotope transmutation. This affects fuel composition over time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The following code block plots the fission and capture cross sections for **U-238, U-235, and Pu-239**, three key isotopes in fission reactors.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **U-235** is the primary fissile isotope in most thermal reactors, with a high fission probability for low-energy (thermal) neutrons.  \n",
    "- **U-238** mainly undergoes radiative capture at thermal energies but can fission at higher neutron energies.  \n",
    "- **Pu-239** is bred from U-238 and behaves similarly to U-235 but with different cross-section characteristics.  \n",
    "\n",
