    "In a nuclear reactor, neutron interactions with fuel isotopes determine the overall reactor behavior. Among many the many reactions in a reactor, two key reactions are:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fission**: A neutron induces the splitting of a heavy nucleus, releasing energy and more neutrons. This is crucial for sustaining a chain reaction.  \n",
    "- **Radiative Capture** ($n,\\gamma$): A neutron is absorbed without causing fission, leading to isotope transmutation in excited state and relaxes by emitting $\\gamma$-radiation. This affects fuel composition over time.  \n",

    "The following code block plots the fission and capture cross sections for **U-238, U-235, and Pu-239**, three key isotopes in fission reactors.  \n",

    "- **U-235** is the primary fissile isotope in most thermal reactors, with a high fission probability for low-energy (thermal) neutrons.  \n",
    "- **U-238** mainly undergoes radiative capture at thermal energies but can fission at higher neutron energies.  \n",
    "- **Pu-239** is bred from U-238 and behaves similarly to U-235 but with different cross-section characteristics.  \n",

    "Although B-10 is often used in reactor applications for controlling reactivity, its neutron absorption primarily occurs through the (n,Œ±) reaction rather than the (n,Œ≥) reaction. In the (n,Œ±) reaction, a neutron is absorbed by a B-10 nucleus, resulting in the emission of an alpha particle and the formation of a lithium nucleus. This reaction is highly effective at absorbing neutrons, making B-10 a valuable material for reactivity control.\n",

    "However, the (n,Œ±) reaction also induces swelling in the control rod material due to the accumulation of helium gas (from alpha particles) and lithium. This swelling can compromise the structural integrity of the control rods over time, leading to challenges in long-term reactor operation and maintenance. As a result, other nuclides, such as cadmium (Cd), silver (Ag), and indium (In), are often used in control rods to mitigate these issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fast reactors, where neutron energies are much higher, these alternative nuclides may not be as effective at neutron absorption due to their energy-dependent cross sections. In such cases, boron is used more frequently despite the swelling issues, as its neutron absorption properties remain effective across a wide range of neutron energies. However, the swelling effect still poses a significant challenge in these applications, requiring careful design and material selection for control rods.  "
